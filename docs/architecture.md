# Architecture

Status: stage 1 (lexing) is implemented. Everything marked *planned* is a
plan, not a contract; it changes as stages are built.

## Pipeline

```text
source text
    |  hgl_lexer
tokens
    |  parser (planned)
syntax tree ---------> formatter (planned) ---------> source text
    |  analyser (planned)
analysed program ----> error reporting (`check`)
    |  optimiser (planned)
analysed program
    |  one transpiler per target (planned)
target output
```

Rules for every stage:

- One input, one output, and the diagnostics sink. No stage reads an earlier
  stage's input.
- Total: bad input is reported and processing continues. A stage does not
  panic or stop at the first error.
- Everything carries a span, so any later stage can report against source.
- No target knowledge before a transpiler.

## Crates

| Crate | Role | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hgl_source` | Source files (UTF-8 check, byte-order mark), spans, line and column lookup | implemented |
| `hgl_diagnostics` | Diagnostic model, sink, terminal rendering | implemented |
| `hgl_lexer` | Source text to tokens; literal text to values | implemented |
| `hgl_cli` | The `hgl` command | `hgl tokens` only |
| parser | Tokens to a lossless syntax tree | planned |
| formatter | Syntax tree to source text | planned |
| analyser | Names, types, phases, const evaluation | planned |
| optimiser | Analysed program to analysed program | planned |
| transpilers | Analysed program to one target each | planned |
| test runner | `hgl test`: `# expect-error` matching, eval cases | planned |

A crate is created when its stage is built, not before.
[rules.md](rules.md) lists each rule of the specification against the stage
that implements it.

## Lexer

Context-free, lossless and total: the same text always gives the same
tokens; the tokens cover the file exactly, comments and whitespace included;
lexing never stops early. A token is cut by its form alone: the longest
symbol is taken whatever surrounds it (LEX-17), and a literal that runs into
a letter, digit or `_` is one malformed token, never a literal and a name
(LEX-18). Five lexical rules need context and are left to the stage that has
it:

| Rule | Left to | What the lexer keeps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Significant line breaks (LEX-5, LEX-6) | parser | every line break as one `Newline` token |
| A comment over several lines counts as a line break (LEX-21) | parser | the comment as one token with its text |
| Contextual names (LEX-9, LEX-10) | parser | `Ident` tokens with their text |
| Literal range under a minus (LEX-7) | analyser | `Minus` and the unsigned literal as separate tokens |
| Documentation attachment (SDOC-1) | parser | `DocComment` tokens |

The lexer settles a literal's shape. `hgl_lexer::literal` settles its value
and the rules that need arithmetic: integer and float range (LEX-7, LEX-20,
LEX-23), date, time and offset fields (LEX-11, LEX-19), zone names (LEX-12),
durations (LEX-13), and the contents of strings and text blocks (LEX-24,
LEX-25). Both read shapes through one private module, `shape`, so they agree
on where a literal ends.

### Encoding

A source is read as bytes. One that is not well-formed UTF-8 gets one
diagnostic, at the first offending byte; nothing else is reported for that
file. One leading U+FEFF is dropped when the file is loaded, so offsets and
columns count from the character after it (LEX-16).

### Line breaks

A line break is LF, CRLF or CR. Each is one line break, they mean the same
everywhere, and a file may mix them (LEX-15).
`hgl_source::line_break_length` is the single definition. The line index,
the lexer and the diagnostic renderer all use it, and tests lex the whole
specification corpus under each form. CI runs the tests on Linux, macOS and
Windows.

## Parser (planned)

### Generic arguments or comparison

In an expression, `name <` opens generic arguments or is a comparison.
GEN-14 decides by what `name` resolves to, which only the analyser knows.
The parser therefore guesses and the analyser confirms (owner decision,
2026-11-13):

- The parser reads ahead to the `>` that would close the list. The generic
  reading is possible when the tokens between form generic arguments and `(`
  follows. When only one reading parses, that reading is the result.
- When both parse, as in `f(a < b, c > (d))` and `a < b > (c)`, the parser
  records its guess, the generic reading, in a node marked *undecided* that
  keeps its tokens.
- The analyser resolves `name`. A generic type confirms the guess; any other
  name re-reads the node as comparisons. A generic type followed by a `<`
  that cannot open its arguments is an invalid application, reported with no
  fallback to comparison (GEN-14).
- The formatter runs without the analyser, so it keeps the author's spacing
  inside an undecided node.

The language is exactly GEN-14; only the stage that applies it differs.

## Diagnostics

A diagnostic has a category from the specification's list, a code, a primary
location, and the rule it enforces. A code is *catalogued* (it appears in the
specification's catalogue) or *local* (the specification rejects the
condition but names no code). Only a catalogued code may satisfy
`# expect-error` (TST-12). Every lexical code is catalogued.
`crates/hgl_lexer/tests/spec_tables.rs` compares the lexer's codes, reserved
words and symbols with the pinned chapters, so a pin that changes one of
them fails a test.

Where two catalogue rows cover one condition the lexer takes one reading,
listed in [hgl_spec issue 11](https://github.com/hhenson/hgl_spec/issues/11)
for the specification to decide:

| Condition | Code used |
| --- | --- |
| Text block that reaches the end of the file | `string.unclosed` |
| Empty zone component, as in `@[Europe//London]` | `date_time.invalid_zone` |
| Backslash directly before a line break in a text block | `string.unknown_escape` |

## Adding a transpiler (planned)

A transpiler is a crate that depends on the analysed-program crate and the
diagnostics crate, and on no other transpiler. `hgl_cli` selects one by
target name. The front end does not change.

First target (owner decision, 2026-11-13): Python wiring for
[hgraph](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph) running on its C++ runtime.
Behaviour that Python wiring cannot express faithfully is added to hgraph on
its `0.9.x` branch, not approximated in generated code.

## Finding source files (planned)

The compiler is given one or more source roots. It reads every `.hgl` file
under them and groups the files by the `module` line each declares. File and
directory names carry no meaning to the compiler; keeping one module's files
together is a convention for readers. The language does not define a file
layout, so this is a compiler rule (owner decision, 2026-11-13).

## Planned order

1. Lexer (this stage).
2. Parser for every grammar in the specification; formatter.
3. Analyser for the scalar slice; `hgl check`; `# expect-error` matching.
4. Transpiler for hgraph; `hgl test` running the core conformance cases.
5. Wider language coverage; optimiser passes; a second transpiler.

## Specification pin

`spec/hgl_spec` and `spec/hgl_core` are submodules. Their commits are the
specification revision this compiler implements. Tests read HGL from them;
no test depends on a file outside this repository.

## Dependencies

An established tool is preferred to hand-written code. A tool that cannot do
the job the way the design needs is dropped.

| Crate | Used by | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clap` | `hgl_cli` | command-line parsing and help text |
| `codespan-reporting` | `hgl_diagnostics` | source excerpts and underlines in rendered diagnostics |

Hand-written where no tool fits:

- The lexer. Durations, temporal literals, "reject the whole literal, never
  split it" and exact error spans do not fit a generated scanner's
  regular-expression table.
- Line lookup. `codespan-reporting` splits lines on LF only, so it is given
  the compiler's own line index through its `Files` trait.

## Toolchain

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the current stable Rust, so everyone and CI build
and lint with the same release. Dependabot proposes the next Rust release,
crate updates and workflow action updates weekly
(`.github/dependabot.yml`). No minimum supported Rust version is declared.
